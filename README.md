### ALPHA RELEASE

If you are fancy to try out the project and noticing _any_
inconvenience, a bug, a missing feature, an ugly API piece, a typo, just
about anything that you would like to see in a better state - please,
open an issue in this repository.

We will try our best to make things better, but we can't if we don't
know what is wanted.
